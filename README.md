# Threat-Hunting-Detection-and-Response

Duration

5 Days

Introduction to Cybersecurity Threats Detection, Hunting and Response.Computer attacks and data breaches are inevitable. It seems like every day a data breach occurs and the victims of the data breach suffer. Their information is stolen or posted online. The companyâ€™s or businesses who had the breach go on, learn a little from the attack, and just give credit monitoring out as if nothing happened. What if you could help prevent a data breach in your organization? The course is designed to guide the learner thru Computer Security specialization.

The course focuses on the detection and mitigation of threats and attack vectors and discusses how to use tools and principles to protect information. By the end of the course, you should be able to make suggestions on what type of detection and mitigation strategy is right for your systems or business given the known threats and attack vectors. You should be able to discuss what features you want in a firewall, or how cash registers or sensitive data systems should be secured.

The project at the end of the course will allow you to apply what you have learned to argue what type of detection and mitigation strategies should have been employed by companies and businesses that have suffered a data breach.
